## My Argument
The movie "Pay it Forward" (2000) tells the story of Trevor McKinney - an 11-year-old boy that launched a goodwill movement known as "pay it forward".<br>
In the movie, Trevor's social studies teacher gives the class an assignment to devise and put into action a plan that will change the world for the better.<br>
Trevor's plan is a charitable program based on the networking of good deeds. He calls his plan "pay it forward", which means the recipient of the favor does a favor for three others, rather than paying the favor back.<br>
In the end, Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself and his close environment, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him.<br><br>
I argue, as the movie suggested, that if everyone will pay good deeds to our surroundings, we can make our neighborhood and the world a better place. 


## Reflection 
I think my simulations successfully demonstrating the argument that with passing good deeds forwards we can not only impact our close family and friends, but we can even impact people we've never met. You can see from the different simulations that the more good deeds people pass forwards, the fastest the cycle affects the entire community. 


## Control buttons:
* **Debug** - Activates debug mode, that shows the number of activated neighbors for every cell.
* **Restart** - Restarts the simulation with a new random neighborhood. 
* **Step** - Shows the next step of the simulation.
* **Play/Stop** - Starts/stops the simulation.
