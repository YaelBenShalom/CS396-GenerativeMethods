This is my webpage for assignment 4 of Generative Methods course.


### Particles type explanation:
* **Fireflys Particles** - The fireflies wander arround, attracts to the user's mouse, and effected by the drag, wind and gravity forces.
* **Spiders Particles** - The spiders wander arround in circles, and effected by the drag, wind and gravity forces.
* **Bugs Particles** - The bugs wander arround, and effected by the other particles in the system.


### UI controls explanation:
Sliders explanation from left to right:
* **Gravity slider** - Changes the effect of the gravity force on the particles.
* **Mouse Attraction slider** - Changes the level of attraction between the particles and the user's mouse (affects only the fireflies).
* **Drag slider** - Changes the level of drag force in the system (larger drag force = slower particles)
* **Wind slider** - Changes the amount of wind exists in the system.

Toggles explanation from left to right:
* **Fireflys Particles toggle** - Turns on the arrows of the forces' magnitude and direction.
* **Spiders Particles toggle** - Turns on the arrows of the forces' magnitude and direction.
* **Bugs Particles toggle** - Turns on the system's heat map.
