## Data Visualization
My app visualizes the emoji-occurrence dataset from the shared data folder.
To interact with the data, Hover over the bars and see how many times the bar's emoji occurred on tweeter's tweets.

The dataset was taken from *emojitracker: realtime emoji use on twitter* (http://emojitracker.com/), at June 4, 2015.
