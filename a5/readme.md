### Chatbot's character and input options:
My cocktail recommendation chatbot will recommend different cocktails according to the user's flavor preferences, and will suggest the cocktail recipe if asked.

The chatbot UI contained 2 types of buttons:

#### Cocktail-flavor buttons:
* **Sweet** - Tells the chatbot that the user likes sweet cocktails.
* **Sour** - Tells the chatbot that the user likes sour cocktails.
* **Bitter** - Tells the chatbot that the user likes bitter cocktails.

#### Action buttons:
* **Get the recipe** - Asks the chatbot for the recipe of the suggested cocktail.
* **Try another cocktail** - Asks the chatbot to suggest another cocktail (with the same flavor).
* **Try different flavor** - Asks the chatbot to suggest a different flavor-cocktail.
