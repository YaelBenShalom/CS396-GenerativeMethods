This is my webpage for assignment 9 of Generative Methods course.


## Description
For this assignment, I created an adjustable face mask. The mask's color, background, and thickness can be changed by the control sliders.
In addition, I adjusted some of Prof. Compton's masks to fit the new sliders.

There are 2 modes - pre-recorded video and real-time video (requires web camera access). The 2 modes can be changed using the "pre-recorded" and "real-time" buttons.


### UI controls explanation:
* **zoom** - Zooms in and out of the mask.
* **backgroundColor** - Changes the background color.
* **color** - Changes the mask color.
* **saturation** - Changes the mask's color saturation.
* **thickness** - Changes the mask's line thickness.
* **eyebrows** - Changes the mask's eyebrows thickness.
